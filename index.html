  <h2>Welcome to Our website<h2>
  <p>You can use this website to know the locations and status as well as density of the manholes on the particular path/road. Try to avoid high density manhole roads in rain season/flooded time. Drivers of heavy vehicles can also get a information about the partial blockage of the roads.</p>

    <section id="Introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>A manhole or maintenance hole is an opening to a confined space such as a shaft, utility vault, or large vessel.</p>
      <p>The main purpose of a manhole is:<p>
        <ul>
        <li>	To perform inspection, cleaning, and removal of any obstruction present in the sewage line.</li>
        <li>	The joining of sewers, the change of direction or the alignment of sewers can be performed with the help of manhole.</li>
        <li>	These have a perforated cover which helps the foul gases to escape. Hence it is a good means of ventilation for the underground sewage system.</li>
        <li>	Manholes help to lay the sewer line in the conventional lengths.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Incidents/Accidents</h3>
        <p>Number of open manholes and damaged slabs on the roadside drains of Hyderabad city have become death traps for citizens and animals.
In rains, the uncovered manholes become invisible which causes accidents of the citizens and animals as they fall into it. At many places commuters have injured and some places vehicles also get stuck.
<p>
        <p>There are certain examples of accidents which have taken place in the city:<p>
         <ul>
        <li>	Hyderabad man who tried to warn people about manhole in Chaderghat hit by speeding car, dies on date: 12th July 2022 </li>
        <li>	Motorist fell close to an open drain and got badly injured near Madina Majid in Hassan Nagar on date: 30th Sep 2021</li>
        <li>	Software employee(35) was killed after falling in an open drain at Manikonda on date:25th Sep 2021</li>
        <li>	A man fell into 20feet dept manhole with his two-wheeler, came out with minor injuries on date: 8th Feb 2018</li>
        <li>	Body of a man found in an open manhole at Gandhi hospital, Hyderabad on date 23 Sep 2015
(Spots of accidents are shown in below Figure)

    <h3>Field Visit</h3>
    
    <p>Data is collected in Kalyanpuri colony of Uppal, Hyderabad. The area is selected by using DEM map by integrating water level and found that this area is a low lying area. Also, this area is flooded and recorded some accidents previously due to open manholes. The data collection is done by a team of five people splitted into different groups and lanes. The accurate coordinates of the manholes are collected using GPS Camera application on mobile phone. Data is then sorted into an excel sheet to generate the maps using QGIS and Surfer</p>

      <h2>Method</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>Choosing the proper area is very important for effectiveness of our work so we have selected the area by integrating Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and groundwater level. This will give information about the low lying area shown in figure. DEM SRTM file was downloaded from USGS earth explorer then imported and plotted in Surfer/QGIS. The 3D view of the file was integrated with groundwater level to understand the low lying and drainage patterns.</p>

<p>Based on the DEM data, the low lying area Kalyanpuri colony of Uppal, Hyderabad is selected for data collection. Also, this area is flooded and recorded some accidents previously due to open manholes. The data collection is done by a team of five people splitted into different groups and lanes. The accurate coordinates of the manholes are collected using GPS Camera application on mobile phone.</p>

<p>The data was digitized and added as a layer in Google my Maps and the code for the map was taken and embedded in our website. As per the need the data can be updated on Google my Maps and this will automatically be updated on website.
Code for our website is written in HTML and the free website domain GitHub is used. Our website is named as https://manhole-mapping.github.io/ and it contains mainly the map of manholes in Kalyanpuri colony and Introduction, methodology and Results. The main purpose of the website is to give a platform to the end users with the information and updates of manholes.</p>
